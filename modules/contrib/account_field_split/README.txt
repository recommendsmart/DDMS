INTRODUCTION
------------

Currently the draggable field "User name and password" mashes together:

 * Username
 * Current password
 * E-mail address
 * Change Password
 * Roles
 * Status
 * Notify user about new account (when admin create new account)

Account Field Split aims to fix that problem for site builders who want to
manage those fields separately.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-drupal-8-modules

CONFIGURATION
-------------

    1. After enabling the module, the module adds new fields on the Account
       Settings' Manage form display, located at Configuration > People >
       Accounts > Form Display.
