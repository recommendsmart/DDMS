Datetime Extras
===============

Extends core Datetime and Datetime Range functionality.

1) "Date and time range with duration" is a field widget for the core
datetime_range field type that allows content creators to select a start
date/time and then optionally define the absolute end time (like the core
widget) or to specify a duration (an offset relative to the start date/time).

To use this widget, a site must additionally install the duration_field module
(version 8.x-2.0-rc2 or higher).
