## DISCLAIMERS
Like the rest of CSS provided by the module, they are meant basic, not final,
to get up and running quickly. It is not the module job to match your
design requirements. It is your own, or your themer's job to make it awesome.

Every theme has different classes and structures. Your site menu contents may
vary, each menu item may or may not contain regions and their blocks. Unless you
hire me I have no idea about it. It is all yours.

No supports will be provided for CSS issues. You either have to learn CSS
yourself if DIY, or hire a themer, if you have no time. I hope you see this from
the bright side. Patches are welcome, including CSS fixes, if you think
it would benefit others.

Feel free to get in touch with me for paid customizations.
