## Introduction

The Textarea Limit module adds in character limiting to selected textarea widgets. Widgets are selected on the respective form display edit form(s). A global character limit can be used, configurable via ad admin form or a local limit can be set.

## Requirements

This module requires the jquery.limit javascript library which is currently loaded externally.

## Install/Usage

* Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See: https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
* Configure global settings at: **/admin/config/content/textarea-limit**
* Setup/add textarea field on entity of choice.
* Adjust field form display formatting options on textarea field. Set custom text limit or use global text limit.
* Now goto create/edit form for entity and inspect textarea field. It should now indicate how many characters are left/limit you.
