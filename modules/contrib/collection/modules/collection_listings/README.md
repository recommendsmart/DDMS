# Collection Listings

Currently, sites using the paragraphs module can create filtered listings of items in a collection. To enable this feature, simply add a collection entity reference field to a paragraph type, and then enable the _Collection listing_ behavior for that paragraph type.

When adding a paragraph item of this type, there will be a new "Behaviors" tab in the UI that allows you to specify the content types, bundles and display modes to include when that listing is rendered, as well as the number of items.
