INTRODUCTION
------------

The Group Flex module makes Group Types and Groups flexible.

It provides a wizard-like functionality to create a new Group Type which will
configure the permissions for you. This is particularly useful for site
administrators. The site administrator can also open the possibility to allow
the group creator to select the available joining method(s) or Group
visibilities for their Group. It leverages the "Group Permissions" module to set
specific permissions on the Group level.
