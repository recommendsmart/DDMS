Introduction - Edit Entity
===========================
This module was born out of a simple need:
the end user wanted a button to go back to the edit form of his entity
when he was on the display of his entity.
This module is inspired by the [Edit This Node](https://www.drupal.org/project/edit_this_node) module.
