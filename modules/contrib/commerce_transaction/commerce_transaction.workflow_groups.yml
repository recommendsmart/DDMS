# Remote state workflow for the Transaction entity.
## We do not provide a default workflow in this module because it is always
## specific to the payment type/gateway. It therefore needs to be provided by the
## integrating module. A `draft` state should be reserved for use when a
## transactions is created in Drupal but not sent to the remote system yet.
## There is a feature in some payment gateways (e.g. BlueSnap) that allows
## sending a merchant transaction ID when requesting a transaction. In such
## cases, transactions can be created in `draft` state before requesting the
## transaction from the remote system so that there is an ID to be sent. If the
## transaction is rejected due to, for example, wrong payment details or fraud
## detection (in which case payments are not created in Drupal) draft
## transactions can be regularly collected and removed. Or they may be used by
## the merchant to have an insight of how frequently customers have payment
## problems during checkout.
