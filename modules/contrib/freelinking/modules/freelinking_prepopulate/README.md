## INTRODUCTION

This module create a prepopulated link to a create node. It is used primarily as
a failover for the **Node title** plugin.  When this module is enabled, the failure
option “Add a link to create content” is added to the failover option for the
**Node title** plugin.

The following items will be inherited from the the parent node and used to
prepopulate the new node:

* Title (inherited from the *target* of the freelink markup).
* Book outline (requires the **Book** module to be enabled).

For example, the following freelink: `[[nodetitle:Does not exist]]`,  produces:

    <span class="freelink freelink-createnode notfound freelink-internal">
      <a title="node/add/article" href="/node/add/article?edit%5Btitle%5D=Does%20not%20exist&parent=836">Does not exist</a>
    </span>

Here, the `parent=836` identifies the book the new node shall be part of.


## REQUIREMENTS

## RECOMMENDED MODULES

* Book:<br>
  When the core Book module is enabled, create node links will be prepopulated
  as being part of the same book as the parent node.

  When this module is enabled, display of the project's `README.md` will be
  rendered with markdown when you visit `/admin/help/freelinking_prepopulate`.
