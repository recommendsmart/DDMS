INTRODUCTION
 ------------

The layout_builder_admin_theme module forces your Drupal site to use the admin
theme when using Layout Manager. Sometimes a custom front-end theme makes using
Layout Builder a nightmare. This problem can be fixed by using the admin theme
instead.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:
 * Layout builder (included in core)


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Navigate to "/admin/config/content/lbat" to toggle the admin theme.
