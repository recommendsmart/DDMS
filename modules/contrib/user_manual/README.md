# User Manual (Module for Drupal 9+)

Allows administrators to create a user manual for the site.

The purpose of this project is to add a place within the site for a manual
that is useful to site editors. This manual can be added/edited by
developers or site administrators. The hope is that this will help keep
manual more up to date, as well as make it more accessible to site
editorial teams.

appear at `/admin/user-manual`.
