# Entity version history

The module provides a "History" tab (local task) for revisionable content entities that have a version field in order to
visualise the versions in a table format.

## Configuration
A version field needs to be selected in the entity version configuration at "admin/config/entity-version/settings" in
order to activate the history tab.\
Note that only revisionable entities with a canonical path are applicable. Even if a field is selected, entities not
matching these requirements will be ignored.
